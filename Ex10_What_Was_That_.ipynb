I showed you two ways to make\n","a string that goes across multiple lines. In the first way, I put the characters \\n (backslash n) between the\n","names of the months. These two characters put a new line character into the string at that point.\n","\n","This \\ (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string. There are various ”escape\n","sequences” available for different characters you might want to use. We’ll try a few of these sequences\n","so you can see what I mean.\n","\n","An important escape sequence is to escape a single-quote ' or double-quote \". Imagine you have a\n","string that uses double-quotes and you want to put a double-quote inside the string. If you write \"I\n","\"understand\" joe.\" then Python will get confused because it will think the \" around \"understand\"\n","actually ends the string. You need a way to tell Python that the \" inside the string isn’t a real double-\n","quote.\n","\n","To solve this problem you escape double-quotes and single-quotes so Python knows to include them in\n","the string. Here’s an example:\n","\n","    ” I am 6 ’2\\” t a l l .” # escape double−quote inside string\n","    ’ I am 6\\ ’2” t a l l . ’ # escape single−quote inside string\n","    \n","The second way is by using triple-quotes, which is just \"\"\" and works like a string, but you also can put\n","as many lines of text as you want until you type \"\"\" again. We’ll also play with these."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wCRzIhYvjLwY"},"source":["tabby_cat = \"\\tI'm tabbed in.\"\n","persian_cat = \"I'm split\\non a line.\"\n","backslash_cat = \"I'm \\\\ a \\\\ cat.\"\n","\n","fat_cat = \"\"\"\n","I'll do a list:\n","\\t* Cat food\n","\\t* Fishes\n","\\t* Catnip\\n\\t* Grass\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","print(tabby_cat)\n","print(persian_cat)\n","print(backslash_cat)\n","print(fat_cat)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OZ9xHw-Fj87N"},"source":["## Escape Sequences\n","\n","This is all of the escape sequences Python supports.
