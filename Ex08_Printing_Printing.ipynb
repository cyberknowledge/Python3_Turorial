This code looks complex, but if you do your comments above each line and break each thing down to its parts, you'll understand it.\n","\n","In this exercise I'm using something called a \"function\" to turn the formatter variable into other strings. When you see me write formatter.format(...) I'm telling python to do the following:\n","\n","* Take the formatter string defined on line 1.\n","* Call its format function, which is similar to telling it to do a command line command named format.\n","* Pass to format four arguments, which match up with the four {} in the formatter variable. This is like passing arguments to the command line command format.\n","* The result of calling format on formatter is a new string that has the {} replaced with the four variables. This is what print is now printing out.\n","\n","\n","    formatter = \"{} {} {} {}\"\n","\n","    print(formatter.format(1, 2, 3, 4))\n","    print(formatter.format(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\"))\n","    print(formatter.format(True, False, False, True))\n","    print(formatter.format(formatter, formatter, formatter, formatter))\n","    print(formatter.format(\n","        \"Try your\",\n","        \"Own text here\",\n","        \"Maybe a poem\",\n","        \"Or a song about fear\"\n","    ))\n","\n","## Your Turn!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zDlDuZgkV4Je"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
