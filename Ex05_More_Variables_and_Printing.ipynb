You embed variables inside a string by using a special {} sequence and then put the variable you want inside the {} characters. You also must start the string with the letter f for \"format\", as in f\"Hello {somevar}\". This little f before the \" (double-quote) and the {} characters tell Python 3, \"Hey, this string needs to be formatted.
